The following bugs were discovered.  

-VillageCard did not increment the actions.
-greatHallCard did not accurately increment the actions.
-smithyCard did not draw the correct number of cards

No other bugs have been found at this time.  Also these bugs have not yet been rectified.  I am not sure if the professor wants me to correct the bugs or leave them and await further guidance.
